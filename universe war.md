## element stones

need an element stone - choose one, it makes you a more powerful form, with strengths and weaknesses
there's monsters

You can start as one of these:

* fire
* water
* electricity/lightning
* earth

These can be found in the field:

* creation - giant cat with yarnball
* destruction (infectected creation) - teddy bear, turns into more fierce alin looking

* dark (infected light)
* life
* death (infected life)
* galaxy - little boy / warrior with a shield

* magic - higher form

## biomes

creation, destruction, life, death, mind, light, dark are everywhere

* forest - earth, fire, magic
* ocean (beaches) - water, earth
* holy (temples) - whatever the people worship is in greater amounts, mind, rare galaxy in towers
* desert - earth, fire
* mountains - earth, gold, platinum, silver, galaxy at peaks
* glaciers - water, ice

## fusions

combine any 2 types, you have 2 element jars, and each vanquished monster gives you some element-framents that optionally go in a jar. element-fragments stay on the field (so they can be collected later, when you have the jar space.)

some fusions add extra regular-game effects:

* water/water - walk on water

## game modes

* start screen - pick character/element-stone
* walk around map
* fight

## later

* crappy world - everythign looks like a bad drawing
* hell
* cute
* boats to cross oceans/rivers
